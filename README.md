Spy is a browser extension that will use an embedding model to embed the content of every single website I vist for purposes of semantic search.

## Todo:

-   [ ] little ui popup you can click on
-   [ ] api call to embedding model + search engine
-   [ ] read manifest json docs and make it actually good
